SnappyChrome
============

Our implementation for the eBay UIUC hackathon.

**IMPORTANT**: We are really reusing the original code from the Google
Image Search Chrome Extension. The original code is released under a BSD
license we are acknowledging copyright of the original code. Thank you
to the original authors.

Our purpose is not to re-brand the original code and to repurpose it for
our own profit. This was done for a hackathon under severe time
constrains.
